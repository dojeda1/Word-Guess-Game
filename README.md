# Wizard Words

### About this Project

This version of the traditional Hangman game is fashioned after the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The game displays what letters you have previously guessed, how many guesses you have left, as well as your wins and losses. The design was inspired by the Marauder's Map and uses jQuery for a number of cool fade-in and fade-out animations.
